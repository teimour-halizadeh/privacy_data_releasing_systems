# Repository for "Gaussian Mechanism Design  in Data Releasing Systems"

The repository for the paper **"Gaussian Mechanism Design for Prescribed Privacy Sets in Data Releasing Systems."** The paper is available on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=PjrYo48AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).

The note book main produces the results for the simulation section of the paper.

## Dependencies

This project primarily uses [CVXPY](https://www.cvxpy.org/) as the main solver, with [MOSEK](https://www.mosek.com/) as the backend for solving optimization problems. Make sure to have these installed and properly configured.
